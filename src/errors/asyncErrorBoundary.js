/* Purpose
   -------------
   Returns an Express handler or middleware function, 
   which is eventually called by Express in place of the delegate function.

   Parameters 
   --------------
   Delegate:  which is an async/await handler or middleware function. This function will be called by the asyncErrorBoundary.
   DefaultStatus: optional parameter that allows you to override the status code returned when delegate throws an error.

    return (request, response, next) => {

        // makes sure that the delegate function is called in a promise chain. 
        // Using Promise.resolve() to call delegate means that the value returned is 
        // guaranteed to have a catch() method, even if delegate isn't an async function.
        Promise.resolve()
        .then(() => delegate(request, response, next))

        // catch() method will default error to {} in the unlikely event that 
        // error is undefined (which will make sure that the destructuring in the next line doesn't fail).
        .catch((error = {}) => {

          // the error object is destructured to status and message variables. 
          // By defaulting message to error, error can be a String or Error object.
          const { status = defaultStatus, message = error } = error;

          // call Next with deconstructed properties.
